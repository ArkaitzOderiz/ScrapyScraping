\chapter*{Abstract}
In the last 15-20 years, the European Union has made a great effort to promote open data policies for the information generated and monitored by the member states. The objective of this policy is to bring this data closer to the population in order to have a better territorial and environmental control. The government of Navarra and Spain contribute to the supply of open data published by different organizations such as the geoportal (\url{https://geoportal.navarra.es/es/idena}) in Navarre or the data or the automatic system of information published by the different hydrographic confederations in Spain.\newline
\newline
The objective of this work is to centralize the information coming from different sources for the prediction and warning of floods by the use of the pluviometric data of the rivers of Navarre. For this, a platform enabled in scraping techniques will be needed on the data already published in multiple web platforms, which will be stored in a database.
